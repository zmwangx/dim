`dim` is an HTML parser and simple DOM implementation with CSS selector support.

`dim`

- is a single module;
- has no dependency outside PSL;
- is not crazy long;
- supports Python 3.5 and forward,

so the file could be directly embedded in any Python 3.4+ application, or even in a monolithic source file.

`dim` is strictly typed and fully documented. Documentation is available at <https://docs.tcl.sh/py/dim/>.

## Development

`make init` installs dev dependencies via `pipenv`.

`pipenv run make` or just `make` runs checks (type, style, etc.) and tests, and builds docs.

See `Makefile` for details.

`Pipfile` is provided solely for development purposes. (As pointed out above, `dim` itself is plug and play.)
